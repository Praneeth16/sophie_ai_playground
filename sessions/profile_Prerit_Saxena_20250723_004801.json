On the last one—200 GPU-ops engineers for AWS—we cut time-to-hire from 12 weeks to 5.4, saving $1.3 M in vacancy cost. The dashboard I’ll share in our next meeting shows live pipeline velocity, pass-through rates, and projected revenue-at-risk.\n\nWe tap a curated pool of 42 k certified technicians and ML-ops pros, benchmarked against Nvidia’s exact compute-stack requirements. Our AI short-lister screens for CUDA familiarity and thermal-management certs in <48 hrs, ensuring every submitted profile clears your first-round bar. No noise.\n\nDedicated delivery team of four senior recruiters, ex-Equinix and Schneider, guarantees 15 qualified submittals per role per week. Contract, contract-to-hire, direct—flex to your demand curve.\n\nLet’s schedule a 15-min call this week; I’ll walk you through the live dashboard.",
